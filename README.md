## About Me

I am honestly don't know what to put here, but hey I just laid that first sentence, haha. I am someone who can't stop searching on new ways to do something, mostly ended up overcomplicating things, because I love the journey of learning how things works under the hood! I make silly projects because it entertains me, it gives me chance to explore as free as I want, and because I want to use it for myself.
