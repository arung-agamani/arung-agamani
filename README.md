# Selamat Datang! Welcome! ようこそ！

Welcome to my profile! My name is Arung Agamani Budi Putera, a software engineer and cloud infrastructure engineer based in Indonesia.  
Sit down, relax, and let's watch some anime together!

## About Me

I focus on web development and web technologies as I find the high relevancy with the current era we're living, thus ended up gaining knowledge from various sectors that connected to internet, let it backend and servers, frontend and mobile apps, and infrastructure. I am someone who can't stop searching on new ways to do something, mostly ended up overcomplicating things, because I love the journey of learning how things works under the hood! I make silly projects because it entertains me, it gives me chance to explore as free as I want, and because I want to use it for myself.
